# TODO

* make the content script only scrape and move the `posts` global var to a background worker, so we can maintain context between page redirects, as it's the case with the linkedin redirect from `linkedin.com` to `linkedin.com/feed` when we visit the home page the first time. In this last case we lose some info about the first posts.
* some times when navigating pages or accessing it for the first time, the button is not injected, a reload may be necessary, fix this!
